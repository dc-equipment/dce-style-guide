        <h1>About this guide</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Global.Comments">From the IBM developerWorks style guidelines.</p>
        <p>Style when used in the context of writing refers to the structure, voice, and tone of formal writing. This guide is for anyone creating commercial technical documentation for <MadCap:variable name="Global.Company Name" />. </p>
        <p>This guide is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to grammar, punctuation, or writing styles. It is intended to guide writers of <MadCap:variable name="Global.Company Short Name" /> technical content in specific usage so that the documentation looks and reads consistently. Where necessary, procedures for working in MadCap Flare have been added. A secondary aim of these prescriptive guidelines is to facilitate translations and help writers and editors of other <MadCap:variable name="Global.Company Short Name" /> documentation and media in achieving a style that is professional and consistent with our other content.</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Global.Comments">English usage changes with time, and experts do not always agree. However, editing for correct usage need not be a daunting task. There is a relatively small list of glaring infractions that writers are wont to produce.</p>
        <p>Consult the Chicago Manual of Style for general writing correctness and the Microsoft Writing Style Guide for matters related to online writing in particular.</p>
        <h2>General guidelines</h2>
        <p>Always write as if you're speaking to a respected professional acquaintance when writing for any audience. Follow these general guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use short imperative or declarative sentences with simple or complex structures (that is, one main clause followed by a limited number of subordinate clauses). </li>
            <li>Use the active voice wherever possible. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Writing_Voice.htm" class="H2andH3">Watch your voice and tone</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li>Avoid normalizing adjectives and verbs.</li>
            <li>Omit weak adjectives and adverbs such as "quite", "very", "probably", and so on. </li>
        </ul>
