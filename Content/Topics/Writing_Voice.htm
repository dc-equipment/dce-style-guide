        <h1>Watch your voice and tone</h1>
        <h2>Use the active voice</h2>
        <p>Identify the agent(s) of action, unless there is good reason for hiding agency. </p>
        <p>Only transitive verbs are said to have voice and the passive voice is always formed by joining an inflected form of <i>to be</i> (or, more colloquially, <i>get</i>) with the verb’s past participle. Look out for forms such as <i>is &lt;verb&gt; by</i>, <i>will be &lt;verb&gt;</i>, and so on. However, note that certain constructions like <i>is &lt;present participle verb&gt;</i> are not passive. </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">The application of the Fail-Safe Brake could result in the rope tension exceeding the safe working load of the system.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">When the fail-safe brake is engaged, the resulting tension could exceed the safe working load of the system.</p>
        <h2>Use the passive voice judiciously</h2>
        <p>Use the third person passive voice to present a choice (for example, users can switch to a lower tension setting if required). Because it emphasizes the action to be carried out and minimizes the importance of the doer. Also use passive voice when it doesn't matter who is doing the action.</p>
        <p>The passive voice is also acceptable when any of these conditions is true:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The system performs the action.</li>
            <li>It is more appropriate to focus on the receiver of the action.</li>
            <li>You want to avoid blaming the user for an error, such as in an error message.</li>
            <li>The information is clearer in passive voice.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Failure to regularly to inspect the Winch Assist system components may compromise the integrity of the system and result in death or serious injury.</p>
        <h2>Use the imperative voice for recommendations</h2>
        <p>The imperative voice begins with a verb and assumes the subject. The imperative voice is concise and eliminates the more didactic forms with the verb "should". Use the imperative voice for recommendations, except when such recommendations are presented in the ANSI format for safety messages. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Language_Alerts.htm" class="H2andH3">Alerts, warning, and cautions</MadCap:xref> for more information.</p>
        <p>Example: </p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Ensure that there are no obstructions between the aerial and the carriage.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Ensure that the aerial and cable will not be damaged by guylines when erecting or lowering the tower.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Point the aerial in the correct direction.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Avoid first person pronouns</h2>
        <p>Avoid first person pronouns, especially the first person plural "we" when making recommendations. Use "<MadCap:variable name="Global.Company Name" /> recommends ..." instead. </p>

        </ul>
        <h2>Do not use backward-referrring pronouns</h2>
        <p>Always repeat the noun that forms the subject of the main clause instead of using pronouns like it, they, this, or these. Repeating the noun makes the reference clear to the reader.</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">Displays the
Status of the
Winch. It has 4
modes.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Displays the status of the winch. The Winch Assist has four modes of operation.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use the present tense</h2>
        <p>Use the present to make your sentences simple and direct.</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">Pull the unaffected rope off the drum. This can be done by walking the tethered machine away from the Winch Assist machine on a low setting.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Walk the tethered machine away from the Winch Assist machine to pull the unaffected rope off the drum.</p>
        <h2>Directly address your readers</h2>
        <p>In addition to framing your statements in the active voice, use the second person pronoun ("you") in the subject of the clause. </p>
