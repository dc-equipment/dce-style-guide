        <h1>Cross references</h1>
        <p>Include your cross-reference and external reference as a single sentence that follows the subject matter that requires additional sources for elucidation. Begin the reference with "Refer to" and do not add a description of the reference or why the reader should go to the trouble of checking it out.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Ensure that the machine is in a zero-energy state. Refer to Precautions for inspection and service for more information.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">Set safe operation limits. Refer to Appendix A Winch PLC parameters for more information.</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">Set safe operation limits. Refer to Appendix A Winch PLC parameters for a full list of the operational parameters.</p>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;TIP - &lt;/b&gt;">Use the Cross-Reference button to add the reference, which will create a lined reference for you in the selected style.</p>
        <p class="Tip" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;TIP - &lt;/b&gt;">The Caption style appends the topic type and number. Use it to include "Chapter N" or "Appendix N" cross-references when required.</p>
        <h2>Multiple references or recommended links</h2>
        <p>In some cases you may want to include a list of additional references or a standalone reference that is not explicitly connected to any part of your text. In such cases, begin the reference with "See also:" and simply include the cross-reference horizontally, or use a bullet list for multiple links. </p>
