        <h1>Lists</h1>
        <p>Use a list when you have three or more important points to reinforce or amplify. Use ordered lists for steps in a task instead of grouping them together in a single, monolithic block of paragraph text. Use unordered lists when the sequence of items is not important.</p>
        <p>Follow these rules when you use lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that you make the purpose of the list clear in the heading.</li>
            <li>Introduce a list with a complete sentence that ends with a colon, except in a horizontal list or a vertical list that is punctuated as a sentence.</li>
            <li>Avoid creating lists that are more than three levels deep.</li>
            <li>Never use a list for only one item and avoid two-item lists.</li>
            <li>Use parallel construction for list items and write in the active voice. Refer to <MadCap:xref href="Writing_Voice.htm" class="H2andH3">Watch your voice and tone</MadCap:xref> for more information.</li>
            <li>If using end punctuation, use it consistently for all items in the list.</li>
            <li>Avoid including the number of steps in the introductory sentence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Vertical list punctuated as a sentence</h2>
        <p>It is perfectly acceptable to complete a sentence begun in the introductory text with items in a vertical list. Use semicolons between the items and end the final item with a period. Each item begins with a lowercase letter, even if the list is a numbered list. </p>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col style="width: 20px;" />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="Borderless">
                        <p class="exampleCorrect">&#160;</p>
                    </td>
                    <td class="Borderless">
                        <p>Take up any slack in the rope by:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>using the Track Lockout Override function; or</li>
                            <li>using the manual wind-in function.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Horizontal (run-in) lists</h2>
        <p>Short, simple list are usually better run in, especially if the introductory text and the items in the list together form a sentence. </p>
        <p>Follow these rules when you use run-in lists:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the introductory sentence forms a grammatically complete sentence, use a colon to offset the list items from the sentence. </li>
            <li>Use numbers or alphabets in parenthesis before each item.</li>
            <li>Separate the items with commas, unless any of the items requires internal commas, in which case all items will usually need to be separated by a semicolon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col style="width: 20px;" />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td class="Borderless">
                        <p class="exampleCorrect">&#160;</p>
                    </td>
                    <td class="Borderless">
                        <p>This presents certain obstacles to maintaining consistency across your projects because: (a) changes made to the layout in one project are not updated in the others; and (b) changes made in the same project by one writer are not updated in another writer's local copy. </p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
