        <h1>Pronouns</h1>
        <p>Do not use pronouns, like he, she, it, and so on. The only pronoun you should use is <i>you</i>. </p>
        <h2>Use nouns, not pronouns</h2>
        <p>Repeat a noun instead of using a backward-referring pronoun like it, they, this, or these. Repeating the noun ensures that the reference is clear.</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">The Winch&#160;Assist is mounted to the base machine using standard bolts. Inspect them regularly to ensure that they are fastened securely.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">The Winch&#160;Assist is mounted to the base machine using standard bolts. Inspect the mounting bolts regularly to ensure that they are fastened securely..</p>
        <h2>Rewrite for gender neutrality</h2>
        <p>Avoid pronouns like he and his in references to a person whose gender is unknown. Instead, rewrite to use the second person (you) or use plural. </p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">To reduce operator fatigue, he should be changed over at regular intervals.</p>

        <h2>Use that and which in relative clauses correctly</h2>
        <p>Very simply, only use which in a relative clause.</p>
        <p class="exampleInCorrect">The winch's planetary gearboxes have inbuilt brakes which are spring applied and hydraulically released.</p>
        <p class="exampleCorrect">The cab is fitted with polycarbonate glass and a metal grille over the front window, which protects the operator from flying debris.</p>
