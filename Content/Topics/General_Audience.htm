        <h1>Audience analysis</h1>
        <p>Before you begin planning your document's structure, identify your audience and their needs with the following questions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Who is your audience?</li>
            <li>What does your audience want to accomplish?</li>
            <li>How can you give your audience the essential information they need to accomplish their goals?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>See also:</p>

        <h2>Primary audience profiles</h2>
        <p>Readers usually <i>refer to</i> product documentation to help them use the product correctly within their particular work situation. To understand which facets of the product need to be amplified for each publication type, you need to understand the goals and concerns of the users of <MadCap:variable name="Global.Company Short Name" /> products. Audience profiles synthesize the needs and competencies of each of your primary audience types into single, generic profiles.</p>
        <p><i>User needs</i> are the expectations that a user has when they use a product or when they assess whether a new product will give them the outcomes they seek. Furthermore, their <i>user competencies</i> govern the verbal and technical complexity of your content. Depending on your audience, you will need to vary the structure, scope, and level of technical detail in your document.
