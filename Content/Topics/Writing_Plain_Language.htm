        <h1>Use plain language</h1>
        <p>Martin Cutts, research director of the Plain Language Commission in the United Kingdom, defines plain language as “The writing and setting out of essential information in a way that gives a cooperative, motivated person a good chance of understanding the document at the first reading, and in the same sense that the writer meant it to be understood.”</p>
        <p>Plain language is easier for everyone to read and conveys meaning in no uncertain terms. Unfortunately, even at this writing, there is no established standard for plain language in place. </p>
