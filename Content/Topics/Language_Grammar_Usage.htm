        <h1>Grammar and usage</h1>
        <p>It pays to be vigilant to the most common (and unpardonable) grammar pitfalls in your sentence constructions. </p>
        <h2>That vs which</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Always use which to introduce (or define) a non-restrictive clause. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Use that for definitions or restrictive clauses.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Subject-verb agreement</h2>
        <table style="width: 100%;">
            <col />
            <col />
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns separated by <i>and</i>, use a plural verb</td>
                    <td>The gear and sprocket are part of the same assembly.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns separated by <i>or</i>or <i>nor</i>, use a singular verb</td>
                    <td>Neither the pen nor the sword is mightier than the word.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>When a compound subject is formed by both a singular and a plural noun or pronoun, the verb should agree with the part of the subject that is closer to the verb</td>
                    <td>&#160;</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

            </tbody>
        </table>
        <h2>Pronoun-antecedent agreement</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Dangling participles and misplaced modifiers</h2>
        <p>A word that ends in <i>-ing</i> often introduces a dangling modifier. When a phrase or word has no object that it can logically modify, it is called a dangling modifier.</p>
