        <h1>Grammar and usage</h1>
        <p>It pays to be vigilant to certain grammar pitfalls in your sentence constructions. </p>
        <h2>That vs which</h2>
        <p>Always use which to introduce (or define) a non-restrictive clause. </p>
        <p>Use that for defining or restrictive clauses.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Subject-verb agreement</h2>

            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns separated by <i>and</i>, use a plural verb</td>
                    <td>The gear and sprocket are part of the same assembly</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>When the subject of a sentence is composed of two or more nouns or pronouns separated by <i>or</i>or <i>nor</i>, use a singular verb</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>When a compound subject is formed by both a singular and a plural noun or pronoun, the verb should agree with the part of the subject that is closer to the verb</td>

        <h2>Dangling participles and misplaced modifiers</h2>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Gender</h2>
        <p>Avoid using gender-specific nouns. Since we advise active constructions, identify the subject as the <i>user</i>. </p>
        <p>Use the gender neutral pronoun <i>they</i> to as a third-person singular pronoun in place of him or her.</p>
