        <h1>Numbers and units of measurement</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Spell out numbers that begin sentences.</li>
            <li>Spell out numbers from one through nine; use numerals for 10 and above.<ul><li>Always use digits for single-digit numbers that are juxtaposed with larger numbers. For example: Switch the receiver unit from channels 5 to 25.</li><li>Always use numerals to express rounded large numbers. For example: Profits were up by USD&#160;3 million since the last quarter.</li></ul></li>
            <li>Use numerals for time, dates, coordinates, scales, and when used alongside units of measure.</li>
            <li>Specify dimensions in both metric and imperial (US) values. The primary unit of measure is metric, with the imperial conversion is parenthesis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Rules for specifying measurements</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a space between the number and the unit of measure.</li>
            <li>Abbreviations and symbols: Do not use abbreviations such as sec, in, or mps. Use s or second, inch, and m/s instead.</li>
            <li>Plurals: Unit symbols are unaltered in the plural: cm not cms.</li>
            <li>Punctuation: Do not follow a unit symbol with a period.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>1800 psi (124 bar)</p>
