        <h1>Main writing principles</h1>
        <h2>Use character formatting sparingly</h2>
        <p>Use bold and italic formatting  sparingly, consistently, and in a meaningful way. Always avoid using uppercase  as this is tantamount to yelling at your reader.</p>

        <h2>Do not over-hyphenate</h2>
        <p>The general rule is that particles such as bi, by, co, de, non, pre, re, un, and so on are not words in themselves and should not be hyphenated when used as a prefix to a word. Only interpose a hyphen when: (a) its absence might confuse the reader (on-screen, wind-in, pay-out); (b) the prefix introduces a double vowel into the word; or (c) the prefix is a compound modifier of the noun.</p>
